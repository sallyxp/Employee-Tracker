# Employee-Tracker
Creation of a Content Management System (CMS) to manage a company's employees using Node, Inquirer and MySQL.

The task was to create a database from the assigned schema and the command line application should allow the users to:
 - add departments, roles, employees
 - view departments, roles, employees
 - update employee roles 

 In addition some bonus features were also requested:
 - update employee manager
 - view employee by manager
 - deletion of employees
 - view the total utilized budget of a department - ie total salaries by department

 A seed file populating the database with some inital data has also been created.

 As this application won't be deployed, links are provided showing walkthrough videos that demonstrate the functionality:

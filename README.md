# Employee-Tracker
Creation of a Content Management System (CMS) to manage a company's employees using Node, Inquirer and MySQL.

The task was to create a database from the assigned schema and the command line application should allow the users to:
 - add departments, roles, employees
 - view departments, roles, employees
 - update employee roles. 

#The database Schema#

![alt text](/Images/Schema.png)

 In addition some bonus features were also requested:
 - update employee manager
 - view employee by manager
 - deletion of employees
 - view the total utilized budget of a department - ie total salaries by department

 A seed file was used to populate the database with some inital data has also been created.

 As this application won't be deployed, links are provided showing walkthrough videos that demonstrate the functionality:

## *Installation*
The user must clone all files from this repository.  It is important that the file locations remain the same in relation to each other.

To run the program, the database must be running.  I have written the program using MySQL Workbench so I have included this below.  

## To start MySQL Workbench (to run the database) ##
Open the XAMPP Control Panel, if user uses Windows, to 'Start' MySQL to connect in the Node terminal

To run, node.js must be installed. The file index.js must be downloaded to a directory. Open the command line (within the same directory as index.js).  inquirer must first be installed before running by typing `npm i inquirer` in the same directory.

Then type `node index.js` to run.  The questions will then be generated with prompts for the user to respond. `CTRL-C` can terminate the program at any point.

NB The package.json is set up correctly to run the program and tests.  Should there be a problem `npm init` can be used to create another.

Once running, the following Menu choices will be displayed:
